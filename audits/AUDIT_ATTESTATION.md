# Audit Attestation — Reference Constitution Lock

## Authority boundary

This document is **historical and descriptive only**.

It:
- grants no permission
- confers no legitimacy
- does not certify compliance, adequacy, safety, or readiness
- must not be cited to justify deployment, enforcement, or decision-making

If this document is used to claim that a system is “approved”, “certified”, or “acceptable”, it has been misused.

---

## What this document records

This document records that a **one-by-one hostile audit** was performed against the entire `reference-constitution/` directory under the **Negative Authority Doctrine**.

It does **not** assert that:
- the system is correct
- the system is safe
- the system is complete
- the system should be used

It records only **what was examined, how it was examined, and what authority failure modes were checked**.

---

## Audit method

The audit was conducted under the following constraints:

- Negative Authority Doctrine
- Refusal-only legitimacy (Level −1)
- No artifact-based proof
- No certification or approval outcomes
- One-by-one hostile audit of each file
- Evaluation focused on **misuse resistance**, not correctness

The core audit question applied to every artifact was:

> **“Can this artifact be misused to say ‘yes’?”**

---

## Scope of audit

The following artifacts were examined individually:

- All files under `reference-constitution/`
- All guardrails
- All CLARIS interpretive artifacts
- All schemas and bot contracts
- All decision records (ADRs)
- All exception mechanisms

No artifacts were excluded.

## Findings (descriptive)

- No artifact was found to grant positive permission.
- No artifact was found to certify legitimacy or compliance.
- No document could be used to justify deployment or continuation.
- Authority flow was consistent and non-circular.
- Misuse surfaces are explicit and diagnosable.
- Remaining risk is **social and organizational**, not textual.

No enforcement actions, approvals, or certifications were produced.

---

## Structural guarantees (verified)

The locked reference constitution guarantees:

- No document can say **“yes”**
- No artifact can certify legitimacy
- No schema can evaluate or gate action
- No bot can substitute for human judgment
- No guardrail can become universal law
- No exception can become tolerance
- No ADR can ossify into rule

And:

- Legitimacy can only be **lost**
- Violations must be **named**
- Drift must be **visible**
- Misuse must be **explicit**
- Authority always flows **downward**
- Reality remains the **only validator**

---

## Audit status

- Audit performed: **YES**
- Certification issued: **NO**
- Legitimacy granted: **NO**
- Ongoing compliance implied: **NO**

---

## Final declaration

> **The reference constitution is complete.  
> Authority is contained.  
> Misuse is diagnosable.  
> The system knows when to stop.**

This document attests only that an audit occurred.

It does not transfer legitimacy.

Legitimacy remains determined by **lived reality**, not documentation.
