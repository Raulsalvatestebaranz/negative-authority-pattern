# Audit Attestation — Negative Authority Pattern

## Authority boundary

This document is **historical and descriptive only**.

It:
- grants no permission
- confers no legitimacy
- does not certify compliance, adequacy, safety, or readiness
- must not be cited to justify deployment, enforcement, or decision-making

If this document is used to claim that a system is “approved”, “certified”, or “acceptable”, it has been misused.

---

## What this document records

This document records that a **hostile, negative-authority audit** was performed against the contents of this repository.

It does **not** assert that:
- the system is correct
- the system is safe
- the system is complete
- the system should be used

It records only **what was examined, how it was examined, and what failure modes were considered**.

---

## Audit method

The audit was conducted under the following constraints:

- Negative Authority Doctrine
- Refusal-only legitimacy (Level −1)
- No artifact-based proof
- No certification or approval outcomes
- One-by-one hostile audit of each file
- Evaluation focused on **misuse resistance**, not correctness

The core audit question applied to every artifact was:

> **“Can this artifact be misused to say ‘yes’?”**

---

## Scope of audit

The following artifacts were examined individually:

- All files under `reference-constitution/`
- All guardrails
- All CLARIS interpretive artifacts
- All schemas and bot contracts
- All decision records (ADRs)
- All exception mechanisms

No artifacts were excluded.

---

## Findings (descriptive)

- No artifact was found to grant positive permission.
- No artifact was found to certify legitimacy or compliance.
- Authority flow was consistent and non-circular.
- No hidden approval paths or certification surfaces were detected.
- Remaining risks were **social and organizational**, not textual.

No enforcement actions, approvals, or certifications were produced.

---

## Diagnostic summary (non-authoritative)

This summary is **diagnostic only** and reflects misuse resistance, not safety or correctness.

- Overall misuse-resistance profile: **High**
- Identified irreducible risk: **human power pressure and willful misuse**
- No unresolved structural authority leaks detected at time of audit.

This summary must not be treated as an endorsement.

---

## Audit status

- Audit performed: **YES**
- Certification issued: **NO**
- Legitimacy granted: **NO**
- Ongoing compliance implied: **NO**

---

## Final statement

This document attests only to the fact that an audit occurred.

It does not transfer legitimacy.

Legitimacy remains determined by **lived reality**, not documentation.
