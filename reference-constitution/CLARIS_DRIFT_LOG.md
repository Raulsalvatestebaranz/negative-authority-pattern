# CLARIS — Drift Log

This document records observed semantic drift: cases where how humans believed a system worked diverged from how it actually behaved.

This log is interpretive only. It introduces no rules, constraints, or prohibitions. If any entry here is cited to justify action, enforcement, or decision-making, it has been misused.

Observed drift does not authorize corrective action, deployment, or continued operation; it only records divergence.

## What this log is for

This log exists to make slow, non-obvious meaning erosion visible over time.

Drift often emerges without explicit decisions and is rarely noticed until failure occurs. Recording drift allows humans to detect patterns before they become structural.

---

## What this log is not for

This log does not:
- Diagnose root causes
- Assign responsibility
- Prescribe fixes
- Declare violations
- Create obligations

Those concerns belong elsewhere.

## Drift entry format

Each entry should record only observable facts:

- **Date observed**
- **Term or concept involved**
- **Prevailing assumption**
- **Observed reality**
- **Context in which drift surfaced**

No remediation. No judgment.
