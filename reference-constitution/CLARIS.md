# CLARIS

## Identity

CLARIS is the interpretive layer of the Sociotechnical Constitution. It exists to preserve shared meaning over time and prevent semantic drift as systems, organizations, and contexts evolve.

CLARIS does not define rules, constraints, or acceptable system behavior. If any interpretation in this document conflicts with `CONSTITUTION.md` or `LEGITIMACY.md`, this document is wrong.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of CLARIS is to ensure that humans use the same words to mean the same things when reasoning about systems governed by the Sociotechnical Constitution.

CLARIS exists to:
- Reduce ambiguity in constitutional language
- Prevent accidental reinterpretation of invariants
- Make misunderstandings visible
- Preserve meaning across time, scale, and personnel change

CLARIS does not exist to:
- Add requirements
- Suggest implementations
- Resolve trade-offs
- Decide outcomes

---

## Authority boundary

CLARIS is interpretive only.

- It may explain what constitutional terms mean.
- It may give examples of correct and incorrect interpretation.
- It may document common misunderstandings.

CLARIS may not:
- Introduce new constraints
- Narrow or expand constitutional scope
- Define “never allowed” states
- Override constitutional text

CLARIS interpretations must never be treated as sufficient to determine compliance, legitimacy, or permission to deploy.

## Interpretation principles

When using CLARIS:

- Interpretations must preserve human understanding and human agency.
- Interpretations must favor lived operation over theoretical compliance.
- Interpretations must assume good faith but defend against misuse.

If a system satisfies constitutional language only on paper, CLARIS must treat that interpretation as incorrect.

---

## Relationship to other documents

- `LEGITIMACY.md` defines whether a system is allowed to exist.
- `CONSTITUTION.md` defines what must never be violated.
- CLARIS explains how to understand that language correctly.

CLARIS does not compete with guardrails, decisions, or operations. Those documents apply meaning; CLARIS preserves it.

---

## Change discipline

CLARIS may evolve as language evolves, but changes must:
- Clarify meaning rather than introduce new meaning
- Be motivated by observed misunderstanding
- Preserve compatibility with the constitution

If a proposed change to CLARIS would alter what is permitted or prohibited, the change is not allowed.

---

## Failure modes (diagnostic only)

CLARIS is failing when:
- Different teams use the same terms to mean different things
- Constitutional language requires meetings to interpret
- People appeal to CLARIS as authority rather than as explanation
- Interpretations drift without being noticed

When these occur, CLARIS must be corrected—not elevated.
