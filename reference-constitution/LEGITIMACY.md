# LEGITIMACY

This system exists to serve humans—not to replace their rights, judgment, dignity, or recourse. It must not create or amplify unjustified, disproportionate, or discriminatory harm; deny contestability; or concentrate power behind opacity or obscurity. It must never treat “the system decided” as accountability, never make irreversible or high-stakes decisions that materially affect people without a humanly usable way to understand, contest, pause, and reverse or mitigate outcomes, and never shift risk onto users or the public while keeping control private. If we cannot clearly identify who is responsible, who is empowered to intervene, who is protected, who may be harmed, and how harm is detected and repaired, then the system is not legitimate—regardless of accuracy, profitability, or novelty—and it must not be deployed.

## Authority boundary

This is a Level −1 document. It defines refusal conditions only.

- It may be cited only to refuse deployment or continued operation.
- It must never be used to justify deployment, continued operation, or to support a claim that a system is “legitimate.”

Legitimacy cannot be certified; it can only be lost.
