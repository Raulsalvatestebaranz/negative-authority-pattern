# CLARIS — Vocabulary

This document defines the authoritative meanings of key terms used throughout the Sociotechnical Constitution. These definitions exist to prevent semantic drift and misinterpretation over time.

This document is interpretive only. It introduces no rules, constraints, or prohibitions. If any definition here conflicts with `CONSTITUTION.md` or `LEGITIMACY.md`, this document is wrong.

Definitions describe meaning, not thresholds. They cannot be “met,” certified, or satisfied; they can only be violated in lived operation.

## System

A system is the combined technical, organizational, and operational structure that produces outcomes. A system includes software, infrastructure, processes, automation, and the humans who design, operate, and are affected by it.

A system is not limited to code.

---

## Human

A human is any person who designs, builds, operates, governs, is subject to, or is affected by a system. Humans include users, operators, maintainers, decision-makers, and those indirectly impacted by system behavior.

“Human” does not mean “end user only.”

---

## Understanding

Understanding is the ability of humans to form accurate mental models of a system’s structure, behavior, and failure modes. Understanding exists only when humans can explain what the system does, predict its behavior within their scope of responsibility, and recognize when it is behaving incorrectly.

Understanding is not equivalent to documentation, transparency artifacts, or the existence of experts.

---

## Agency

Agency is the ability of humans to meaningfully and safely influence a system over time. Agency includes the ability to change behavior, pause or stop execution, undo or mitigate harm, recover from failure, and clearly exercise responsibility.

Agency is not equivalent to access, permission, or theoretical control.

---

## Preserve

To preserve means to maintain a property as the system evolves. Preservation requires that the property holds across scale, time, ownership change, incident conditions, and partial failure.

A property that holds only under ideal conditions is not preserved.

---

## Over time

Over time includes initial development, growth, maintenance, incident response, degradation, and long-term operation under real-world pressure. Claims that hold only during normal operation or early phases do not satisfy “over time.”

---

## Accountability

Accountability is the condition in which specific humans are clearly responsible for system behavior and outcomes, and have both the authority and capability to intervene.

Accountability cannot be delegated to a system, model, or automated process.

---

## Contestability

Contestability is the ability for humans to question, challenge, pause, or appeal system behavior in a way that can meaningfully affect outcomes.

Contestability requires more than explanation; it requires the possibility of intervention.

---

## Failure

Failure is a system state in which human understanding or human agency is degraded, regardless of whether the system is still producing correct outputs.

Failure is not limited to outages or errors.

---

## Drift

Drift is the gradual divergence between how humans believe a system works and how it actually behaves. Drift often occurs without explicit decisions and is frequently invisible until failure occurs.

Drift is a warning signal, not a moral failing.

If a definition in this document is cited to justify action, enforcement, or decision-making, it has been misused.
