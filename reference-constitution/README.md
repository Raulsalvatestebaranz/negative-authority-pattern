# The Sociotechnical Constitution

## Authority boundary

This repository is a constitutional control system.

This `README.md` is **descriptive only**:
- It **does not** define system behavior.
- It **does not** grant permission to deploy or continue operating anything.
- It **must not** be cited to justify action, enforcement, or claims of compliance.
- If anything here conflicts with `LEGITIMACY.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, or `GOVERNANCE.md`, **this README is wrong**.

If you came here for a rubber stamp: we are tragically out of stock.
