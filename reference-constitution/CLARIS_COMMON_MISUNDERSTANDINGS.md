# CLARIS — Common Misunderstandings

This document records common misinterpretations of the Sociotechnical Constitution and explains why they are incorrect. It exists to prevent semantic drift and misuse of constitutional language over time.

This document is interpretive only. It introduces no rules, constraints, or prohibitions. If any explanation here conflicts with `CONSTITUTION.md` or `LEGITIMACY.md`, this document is wrong.

No individual section or example in this document may be cited independently to justify action, enforcement, or claims of compliance.

## Misunderstanding: “If the system works, it’s valid.”

**Why this is wrong**

Validity is not determined by correctness, uptime, accuracy, or performance. A system can function correctly while already violating the constitution.

**Correct interpretation**

A system is valid only while it preserves human understanding and human agency over time. Correct outputs do not compensate for loss of control, legibility, or recoverability.

---

## Misunderstanding: “At least one expert understands it.”

**Why this is wrong**

Understanding concentrated in a single individual does not preserve human understanding. It creates fragility, dependency, and silent risk.

**Correct interpretation**

Human understanding exists only when competent humans can reason about the system without reliance on hero knowledge or specific individuals.

---

## Misunderstanding: “We documented it, so it’s understandable.”

**Why this is wrong**

Documentation does not guarantee understanding. Documents can exist while humans are unable to predict behavior, detect failure, or reason about change.

**Correct interpretation**

Understanding exists only when humans can form accurate mental models that match lived system behavior.

---

## Misunderstanding: “Users are safe, so agency is preserved.”

**Why this is wrong**

User safety alone does not preserve human agency. Agency includes the ability of operators, maintainers, and decision-makers to intervene, change behavior, and recover safely.

**Correct interpretation**

Human agency is preserved only when those responsible for the system can meaningfully and safely influence it over time.

---

## Misunderstanding: “We can’t roll back, but we’re careful.”

**Why this is wrong**

Carefulness is not a substitute for agency. Systems that rely on caution, expertise, or bravery to remain safe are already violating the constitution.

**Correct interpretation**

Human agency requires structural reversibility or mitigation paths, not individual vigilance.

---

## Misunderstanding: “The model decided.”

**Why this is wrong**

Attributing decisions to a system, model, or automation removes accountability and obscures responsibility.

**Correct interpretation**

Humans remain accountable for system behavior and outcomes. Automated components do not hold responsibility.

---

## Misunderstanding: “This is just a temporary exception.”

**Why this is wrong**

Undocumented or indefinite exceptions erode understanding and agency over time, even when intentions are good.

**Correct interpretation**

Exceptions must be explicit, owned, bounded, and time-limited. Otherwise, they represent silent constitutional violations.

---

## Misunderstanding: “This document tells us what to do.”

**Why this is wrong**

CLARIS documents do not prescribe action. They exist to clarify meaning, not to guide behavior or decision-making.

**Correct interpretation**

If CLARIS is used to justify enforcement, decisions, or actions, it has been misused.

## Scope note

This list is not exhaustive. New misunderstandings may be added when they are observed in practice. Removing a misunderstanding does not change what is permitted or prohibited; it only reflects changes in how language is misused.

If any explanation in this document is cited to justify action, enforcement, or decision-making, it has been misused.
