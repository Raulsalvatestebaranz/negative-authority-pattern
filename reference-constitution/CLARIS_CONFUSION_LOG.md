# CLARIS — Confusion Log

This document records instances where constitutional or CLARIS language caused confusion, disagreement, or inconsistent interpretation.

This log is interpretive only. It introduces no rules, constraints, or prohibitions. If any entry here is cited to justify action, enforcement, or decision-making, it has been misused.

Confusion must never be treated as permission to act, delay refusal, or weaken constitutional boundaries.

## What this log is for

This log exists to surface ambiguous language, overloaded terms, or misunderstood concepts as they are encountered by humans.

Confusion is a signal that meaning may need clarification, not that behavior is wrong.

---

## What this log is not for

This log does not:
- Decide which interpretation is correct
- Resolve disputes
- Define policy
- Create precedent
- Act as authority

Its sole function is visibility.

## Confusion entry format

Each entry should record:

- **Date observed**
- **Term or phrase involved**
- **Conflicting interpretations**
- **Context in which confusion arose**

No resolution is required at time of entry.
