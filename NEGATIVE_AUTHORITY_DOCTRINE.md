# Negative Authority Doctrine

## Authority boundary

This document is **descriptive only**. It grants **no permission**, confers **no legitimacy**, and cannot be used to justify deployment, continued operation, enforcement, gating, or claims of correctness.

If this document conflicts with `LEGITIMACY.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, or `GOVERNANCE.md`, **this document is wrong**.

This doctrine constrains **how authority is claimed and cited**. It does not define system behavior.

---

## Purpose

Most systems fail not because their rules are wrong, but because they become **certifiable**.

This doctrine exists to prevent the most dangerous governance failure:

> **Legitimacy theater** — where paperwork, review, or structure substitutes for lived reality.

The goal is not to create a better approval system.  
The goal is to make **false permission** harder to manufacture.

---

## Core rule

> **Authority is subtractive. Nothing here can grant legitimacy; legitimacy can only be lost in reality.**

If a document, schema, checklist, tool, or process can be used to say **“yes”**, it is too powerful.

---

## Rule of evidence

A system may appear compliant while already failing.

Therefore:

> **Satisfaction cannot be demonstrated by documentation, process, review, attestation, or structure alone.**

Artifacts may support understanding, but **they are not proof** of preserved understanding or agency.

Reality is the witness:
- lived operation
- incidents
- partial failure
- scale, time, and staffing changes
- conditions where humans must intervene

---

## Anti-certification principle

Legitimacy is not a badge.

> **Legitimacy cannot be certified; it can only be lost.**

Any claim that a system is “legitimate,” “approved,” “ready,” “safe,” or “compliant” because:
- a checklist passed
- a schema validated
- a review was completed
- a template was filled
- a dashboard is green

…is exactly the kind of false permission this doctrine rejects.

---

## Forbidden uses

The following uses are explicitly disallowed:

- approval / certification / ratification of systems
- compliance scoring or maturity grading
- automated legitimacy or readiness decisions
- using templates as law
- using schemas as evaluators
- citing interpretive text to justify enforcement or action
- treating “we followed the process” as evidence of validity
- deferring responsibility to “the system,” “the model,” “the tool,” or “the framework”

If your goal is to produce a “pass,” you are already outside this doctrine.

---

## Allowed uses

This doctrine allows only **negative** and **diagnostic** outputs:

- identifying where authority lives (navigation)
- identifying where authority is being misused (misuse detection)
- identifying where false permission is being manufactured (theater detection)
- refusing deployment or continued operation when legitimacy is lost
- recording explicit deviation as exceptions (truth, not permission)
- preserving historical intent (decisions), without creating new rules

This doctrine is allowed to **invalidate**, **refuse**, and **name misuse**.  
It is not allowed to approve.

---

## How this doctrine applies across the stack

### Level −1: `LEGITIMACY.md`
- Defines refusal conditions only.
- May be cited only to **refuse** deployment or continued operation.
- Must never be used to justify a claim of legitimacy.

### Level 0: `CONSTITUTION.md`
- Defines invariants (human understanding, human agency).
- Invalidates systems when invariants fail in reality.
- Must not be converted into a checklist or compliance program.

### META: `GOVERNANCE.md`
- Preserves document authority boundaries.
- Must not introduce new invariants or prohibitions.

### Level 1: CLARIS (interpretive)
- Explains meaning; prevents semantic drift.
- Must never decide outcomes or justify action.

### Level 2: Guardrails
- Local “never allowed” boundaries within explicit scope.
- Must cite which invariant they protect.
- Must not become universal law.

### Level 3: Decisions (ADRs)
- Preserve memory and intent.
- Do not create permission or rules.

### Level 4: Exceptions
- Record explicit, temporary violations with owner + scope + sunset.
- Exceptions are accumulated failure, not approval.

### Level 5: Operations
- Tools, workflows, templates: zero authority.
- Must lose to higher levels on conflict.
- If ops become “the way permission is granted,” the system is captured.

## Misuse signals

This doctrine is being violated when you hear:

- “We’re compliant.”
- “We passed the review.”
- “The checklist is green.”
- “The schema validated.”
- “The tool says it’s safe.”
- “The model decided.”
- “We can deploy because the process was followed.”

Or when humans stop debating reality because:
> “the document/framework says so.”

If these appear, the system has started transferring responsibility away from humans.

---

## Minimal integrity tests

These are not approval tests. They are **misuse detectors**.

A document or artifact is too powerful if it can answer:
> “So can we do this?”

A tool or schema is too powerful if it can output:
- approved / ready / compliant / valid / safe
- pass / fail / score / confidence / risk level

A checklist is too powerful if “passing” it becomes a substitute for:
- observing lived operation
- preserving intervention capability
- recording exceptions when reality violates constraints

Absence of findings is not approval.  
Silence is not legitimacy.

---

## Change discipline

This doctrine should change only if a real failure occurs where:
- false permission was manufactured despite these rules, or
- this doctrine accidentally enabled certification behavior.

Cosmetic edits, tone edits, and “clarity improvements” are not sufficient reason to modify it.

---

## Final constraint

This doctrine exists to make one move impossible:

> **Using paperwork to replace responsibility.**

If an artifact makes it easier to avoid human accountability, it has already failed.

---

## Diagnostic assessment (non-authoritative)

This rating is **diagnostic only**.  
It does **not** grant approval, permission, legitimacy, or readiness.

It reflects **misuse resistance and authority containment**, not correctness or safety.

**Score:** **9.5 / 10**

**Rationale:**
- No positive permission paths exist.
- Certification and compliance theater are structurally blocked.
- Authority boundaries are explicit and hard to invert.
- Remaining risk is social misuse under sustained pressure, which cannot be eliminated by text alone.
