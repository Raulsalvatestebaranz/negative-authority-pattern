# Observance and Consistency

## Authority boundary

This document is **descriptive only**.

It:
- grants no permission
- confers no legitimacy
- does not require updates, reviews, or actions
- must not be cited to justify deployment, enforcement, or decision-making

If this document is used to argue that something must be updated, renewed, or approved, it has been misused.

This document describes **how restraint is maintained**, not how authority is exercised.

---

## Purpose

This repository is designed to remain correct by **not changing**.

Most governance systems degrade because they:
- chase freshness
- require periodic re-approval
- treat time passing as failure
- substitute maintenance rituals for reality

This document exists to explain why **silence and stability** are intentional here.

> **Growth is not adding more — it’s surviving new pressure without lying.**

---

## Principle: failure-driven change

Changes in this repository are **failure-driven**, not time-driven.

Nothing is updated because:
- time passed
- standards evolved
- tools changed
- someone asked for “best practices”
- an audit cycle completed

Updates occur **only** in response to **observed failure**.

---

## What constitutes a valid trigger

A change may be considered **only** when one of the following occurs:

1. **Demonstrated misuse**
   - A document is used to justify permission, approval, or compliance
   - An artifact is treated as certification
   - A bot or schema replaces human judgment

2. **Structural contradiction**
   - Two documents are shown to conflict in practice
   - Authority flow becomes ambiguous during real use

3. **Observed real-world failure**
   - A system using this pattern fails in a way the documents did not anticipate
   - Authority leakage occurs despite existing constraints

Absent these, no change is justified.

---

## What is explicitly not a trigger

The following **must never** trigger updates:

- “Keeping things current”
- “Annual review”
- “Best practice alignment”
- “Industry standard updates”
- “Re-certification”
- “Continuous improvement”
- “Process maturity”

Time passing is not a signal.

---

## How consistency is preserved

Consistency is preserved through:

- Explicit authority boundaries
- Negative (refusal-only) legitimacy
- Interpretive isolation (CLARIS)
- Localized guardrails
- Explicit exceptions
- Historical decision records
- Visible drift and confusion logs

These mechanisms detect problems **without requiring constant change**.

---

## What to do when nothing is wrong

When:
- no misuse is observed
- no contradiction emerges
- no real-world failure occurs

The correct action is:

> **Do nothing.**

Silence is not neglect.  
Silence is evidence that the system is behaving as designed.

---

## Final constraint

This repository does not stay “high quality” by being updated.

It stays high quality by being **hard to misuse**.

If nothing is breaking, nothing needs fixing.
